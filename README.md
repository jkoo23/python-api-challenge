Part 1: WeatherPy
In this notebook, a Python script is created to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. A representative model of weather is created to prove which factors of weather are affected by the distance from the equator. The geographic coordinates are randomly generated and then assigned to the nearest city. Using OpenWeatherMap API, weather data is gathered and used to showcase relationships between latitude and several weather factors.
